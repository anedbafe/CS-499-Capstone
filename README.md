  <span style="font-size: 24px;">Welcome to My Capstone ePortfolio</span>
</p>

<p>
  My name is Angel Baez, and I am honored to share this ePortfolio as the final product of the CS-499 Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio brings together the knowledge, skills, and dedication I have developed throughout the Computer Science program.
</p>
<p>
  Inside, you will find enhanced projects that demonstrate my abilities in full-stack development, data structures and algorithms, and database management, each one a reflection of my growth as a future computer science professional.
